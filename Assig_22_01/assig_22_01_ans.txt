#rules of default parameters, method name:
-> method name should start with small alphabet
-> required parameters are the most favored, followed by default parameters then lastly optional parameters.

e.g.. def print_parameters(pram1, pram2 = 5, pram3*)
        end

#difference between lambda and proc
-->  a lambda checks the number of arguments passed to it, while a proc does not. 
This means that a lambda will throw an error if you pass it the wrong number of arguments, 
whereas a proc will ignore unexpected arguments and assign nil to any that are missing

Another difference between procs & lambdas is how they react to a return statement.

A lambda will return normally, like a regular method.

But a proc will try to return from the current context where it is defined.
